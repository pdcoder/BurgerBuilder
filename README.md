## Burger Builder App

This app , which have I have designed to implement my knowledge of ReactJS. This app basically helps us in customizing a burger, and then order it also. The backend of the app is desugned with firebase, as I wanted to concentrate on the frontend only in this app. Redux state management is used to store all posible states in the app - like loading spinner, backdrop modal, etc. The app has a responsive design , which means that in mobile devices also, it has a beautiful layout. This I have achieved by using a Side Navigation drawer on mobile devices which gives it a feel of a native app.
